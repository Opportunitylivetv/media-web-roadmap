    <h1>Internationalization requirements</h1>
                <p>In order to ensure that users around the globe have access to features that are relevant to their culture, we need to understand what those features are, and how they should work. The first step is to gather the requirements from stakeholders. Then we need to help specification developers and browser/ebook implementers to find that information, so that they can cater for the end user's requirements in their technology.</p>
                <p>This page only lists ongoing efforts. For a view of all available resources see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/layout">Layout &amp; typography</a>.</p>

      <p>The <a data-featureid="typography">Typography Index</a> points browser implementers and specification developers to information about how to support typographic features of scripts or writing systems from around the world, and also points to relevant information in specifications, to tests, and to useful articles and papers. It is not exhaustive, and will be added to regularly as more resources surface.</p>
      <p>The <a data-featureid="type-samples">Type Samples Repository</a> is a place to find and contribute examples of typographic features in text, especially from non-Latin scripts.</p>
